# Project-Concepts
## Project 1
In project 1, I'd like to visualize the music piece - Canon in D Major by telling a romantic story about two lovers living in different city. 
In the structer of Canon, there are two main parts - the initial melody, is called the leader, while the imitative melody, which is played in a different voice, is called the follower. The follower must imitate the leader, either as an exact replication of its rhythms and intervals or some transformation thereof. In the end, they will merge and never separate.

### The user 
- Everyone
### The experience 
- Experience the beauty of the Canon and love
### How to achive 
- The two people are just like the initial melody and the imitative melody in the Canon - They don't live in the same place, but they can follow the own routes until they finally meet.
